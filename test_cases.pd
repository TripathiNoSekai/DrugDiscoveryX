1. API Integration and Helper Functions
Test perform_api_request (with Retry):
Scenario A: Simulate a successful GET request.
Input: Valid URL with known JSON response.
Expected: JSON data returned without raising an exception.
Scenario B: Simulate a failure (e.g., network error) and then eventual success (or eventual failure after retries).
Input: URL that fails a set number of times.
Expected: The function retries up to max_attempts and then either returns a result (if recovery happens) or raises the exception after the final attempt.
Test Caching Functions (fetch_compound_data, fetch_uniprot_data, etc.):
Scenario: Call the same function twice with the same input.
Input: A sample compound or protein name.
Expected: The second call should hit the cache (you can measure performance or check internal cache statistics if exposed).
2. Database Initialization and Operations
Test initialize_database:
Scenario: Run the initialization function and then verify that the expected tables exist in the database.
Input: No direct input; simply call the function.
Expected: Database file contains tables GeneExpression, VirtualScreening, ADMET, Targets, and Leads.
Test Database Write/Read:
Scenario A: Insert a target using target_identification and then fetch it.
Input: Run target_identification().
Expected: The returned target should be stored in the Targets table.
Scenario B: Test update operations (e.g., after calling target_validation, verify that validation_score is updated).
3. Drug Discovery Pipeline Functions
Test target_identification:

Scenario: Verify that the function returns a valid target string and that the target is saved in the database.
Test target_validation:

Scenario: Provide a sample target, check that the docking score is within the expected range (0.0 to 1.0), and confirm the Boolean flag is correct based on the score.
Test hit_lead_identification:

Scenario: Run the function for a given target and verify that the returned leads DataFrame is not empty.
Input: Valid target string.
Expected: DataFrame with columns such as compound, score, and cluster.
Test lead_optimization:

Scenario: After inserting sample leads (or running hit_lead_identification), call lead_optimization() and verify that the optimized_score column is updated.
Test ADMET Analysis:

Scenario: Call admet_analysis with a valid compound name.
Input: A compound name that fetch_compound_data can handle (or mock its response).
Expected: A dictionary with keys like lipinski_rule, logP, etc., and a corresponding entry in the ADMET table.
Test clinical_trial_simulation:

Scenario: Run the simulation function and check that the returned simulation data contains expected keys (MTD_mg and efficacy_percent).
Note: Since the function also generates a plot, you might want to run the logic part separately or use a headless testing environment for matplotlib.
Test Regulatory Report:

Scenario: After performing several operations (inserting targets, leads, ADMET data), call regulatory_report() and verify that a JSON report is generated and written to file.
Input: Pre-populated database.
Expected: A JSON structure with sections for Targets, Leads, and ADMET.
4. Machine Learning and Virtual Screening
Test train_ml_model:
Scenario: Simulate a scenario with pre-populated VirtualScreening data and verify that the ML model is trained (e.g., the model file exists and the logged MSE is within an expected range).
Test virtual_screening:
Scenario: Provide a valid gene name and verify that the function performs screening, writes the results to the database, and calls the training function.
Input: A non-empty gene string.
Expected: A DataFrame with columns compound and score and appropriate database entries.
5. Gene Expression Data Functions
Test fetch_gene_expression_data:
Scenario A: Use a valid gene name that is not in the database to trigger fetching from NCBI Entrez.
Input: A valid gene string.
Expected: Data is fetched (or simulated if using dummy data), stored in the database, and then visualized.
Scenario B: Call the function twice and ensure that the second call uses cached data (as per the logging message indicating cached usage).
6. CLI and GUI Functionality
Test CLI Argument Parsing:

Scenario: Simulate command-line inputs for various commands (e.g., init-db, train, virtual-screening gene_name) and verify that the correct functions are called.
Expected: Outputs or database changes corresponding to the CLI command.
Test GUI Callbacks:

Scenario: Simulate button clicks for GUI commands (if using a framework that allows GUI testing or by refactoring command functions to be callable from tests).
Input: Test inputs for virtual screening, gene expression fetch, etc.
Expected: The corresponding function runs and updates the output display accordingly.
Test Chat Assistant:

Scenario: Input a sample chat message and check that the assistant produces a response.
Note: This might require mocking the DialoGPT model or verifying that the response string is non-empty.
7. Error Handling and Edge Cases
Invalid Inputs:
Scenario: Call functions like fetch_gene_expression_data or virtual_screening with an empty string or only whitespace.
Expected: The function logs an error and does not attempt further processing.
API Failure Simulation:
Scenario: Use mocking to simulate an API call failure (raise an exception) and verify that the retry decorator correctly retries and eventually raises the error if all attempts fail.
Database Connection Errors:
Scenario: Simulate a database error (e.g., wrong DB path) and ensure that the error is caught and logged.
Final Remarks
Each test case should assert:

The correct output (or behavior) based on input.
Side effects (such as database writes or file exports).
That logging messages match expected outcomes in error conditions.
