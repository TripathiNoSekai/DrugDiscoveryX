## Features


![Drug Discovery X](https://github.com/TripathiNoSekai/DrugDiscoveryX/blob/main/Drug_Discovery_X.svg)



- **AI/ML-Driven Virtual Screening**  
  Employ a trained `RandomForestRegressor` to predict compound efficacy and streamline the screening workflow.

- **API Integrations**  
  Retrieve data from PubChem, UniProt, ClinicalTrials.gov, DrugBank, and moreâ€”ensuring you have the latest information on compounds and targets.

- **Data Management & Visualization**  
  Export results to CSV/Excel and generate insightful plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Present data clearly using PrettyTable.

- **User-Friendly Interfaces**  
  - **CLI** for straightforward, scriptable commands  
  - **GUI** built with Tkinter, featuring an integrated DialoGPT chat assistant for interactive guidance

- **Modular Design**  
  Easily extend the pipeline with additional functionalities, advanced ML models, or new API integrations.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Linux, macOS, or Windows  
- **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher  
- **Familiarity:** Basic knowledge of Python and command-line operations

> **Note:** If you plan on using the GUI, ensure `tkinter` is installed. Some operating systems may require installing it manually (e.g., `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` on Ubuntu).

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TripathiNoSekai/DrugDiscoveryX.git
cd DrugDiscoveryX
```

### 2. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn requests prettytable biopython scikit-learn transformers torch openpyxl tk

```

> **Note:**  
> - Ensure that `requirements.txt` is present in the repository.  
> - If `tkinter` is not installed:  
>   - **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`  
>   - **macOS (Homebrew):** `brew install python-tk`  
>   - **Windows:** Typically included with standard Python distributions (verify if needed).

## Configuration

Before running the script, configure the following environment variables (adjust paths and email as needed):

```bash
export ENTREZ_EMAIL="your_email@example.com"
export DRUG_DISCOVERY_DB="drug_discovery.db"
export VIRTUAL_SCREENING_MODEL="virtual_screening_model.pkl"
```

- **ENTREZ_EMAIL:** Used by NCBI Entrez for identifying your requests.
- **DRUG_DISCOVERY_DB:** SQLite database file path.
- **VIRTUAL_SCREENING_MODEL:** File path to store/load the trained machine learning model.

> **Tip for Windows Users:**  
> Use `set` instead of `export` in Command Prompt, or adjust to PowerShell syntax.

---

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Run specific pipeline tasks using the following commands:

- **Initialize the Database:**
  ```bash
  python DDP_4.py init-db
  ```
- **Train the Machine Learning Model:**
  ```bash
  python DDP_4.py train
  ```
- **Perform Virtual Screening:**
  ```bash
  python DDP_4.py virtual-screening <gene_name>
  ```
- **Fetch Gene Expression Data:**
  ```bash
  python DDP_4.py fetch-gene <gene_name>
  ```

#### Other Common Commands:
- **Target Identification:**
  ```bash
  python DDP_4.py target-id
  ```
- **Target Validation:**
  ```bash
  python DDP_4.py target-validate <target_name>
  ```
- **Hit/Lead Identification:**
  ```bash
  python DDP_4.py hit-lead <target_name>
  ```
- **Lead Optimization:**
  ```bash
  python DDP_4.py lead-opt
  ```
- **ADMET Analysis:**
  ```bash
  python DDP_4.py admet <compound_name>
  ```
- **Simulate Clinical Trial:**
  ```bash
  python DDP_4.py simulate-clinical <compound_name>
  ```
- **Generate Regulatory Report:**
  ```bash
  python DDP_4.py report
  ```
- **Export Compound Data:**
  ```bash
  python DDP_4.py export-compound <compound_name>
  ```
- **Plot Molecular Weights:**
  ```bash
  python DDP_4.py plot-weights <compound1> <compound2> ...
  ```
- **Fetch KEGG Pathway Data:**
  ```bash
  python DDP_4.py kegg <gene_name>
  ```

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

To launch the GUI:

```bash
python DDP_4.py
```

The GUI provides:

## Troubleshooting

- **Dependency Issues:**  
  Ensure you have installed all required packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) within your virtual environment.
- **API Connection Errors:**  
  Verify your network/firewall settings and ensure you can reach external APIs like PubChem or UniProt.
- **Database Errors:**  
  Confirm that `DRUG_DISCOVERY_DB` points to a valid file path and that you have the proper read/write permissions.
- **GUI Launch Problems:**  
  Ensure Tkinter is properly installed. If errors related to Tkinter occur, install the appropriate system package.
- **Logging:**  
  The script uses Pythonâ€™s logging module. Check the console output for detailed error messages.
